<h2>Experience</h2>

<h3>Systems Engineer — Battlegrounds Live Gaming — 2011-2015</h3>
<p>Battlegrounds was an advanced laser tag system, composed of highly responsive player hardware, an interactive playing field, and a sophisticated and customizable player experience. My responsibilities varied extensively, but I was continuously involved in electronics prototyping using off-the-shelf parts, embedded software development in Arduino/C++, and internal tools development in Python, as well as top-level design of all aspects of the project. In only four years, our six-person team developed a complete laser tag system from scratch and gave over 1000 testers an unforgettable experience.</p>
